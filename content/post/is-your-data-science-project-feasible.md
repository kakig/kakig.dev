Is the project feasible? This is one of the first questions that should be
asked when thinking about a new data science project. Fortunately, it is
possible to have a satisfactory answer and save a ton of money and effort
before committing to a difficult or even impossible project.

The first step is to gather information about the problem. Searching the
academic literature for articles that solved the same or similar problems helps
to give an idea of the data required and how well your team will be able to
solve the problem.
